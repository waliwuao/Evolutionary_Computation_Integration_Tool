# Evolutionary_Computation_Integration_Tool
This toolkit implements multiple optimization algorithms for polynomial coefficient fitting (using sine function as example), including PSO, DE, GA, and WPA. These algorithms find optimal polynomial coefficients through population iteration to minimize MSE between predictions and true values.
